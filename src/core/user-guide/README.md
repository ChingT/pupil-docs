## Additional Parts

#### World Camera
The high speed 2d world camera comes with two lenses.
60 degree FOV lens (shown on the left) and a wide angle 100 degree FOV lens (shown on the right).

The world camera lens are interchangeable, so you can swap between the two lenses provided for normal or wide angle FOV.

If you change lenses you need to recalibrate the camera to update intrinsics. Otherwise 3d calibration and accuracy test will not work properly!

#### Arm Extender
If you need to adjust the eye cameras beyond the built in adjustment range,
you can use the orange arm extenders that are shipped with your Pupil headset.
Unplug your eye camera. Slide the existing eye camera arm off the headset.
Slide the arm extender onto the triangular mount rail on the headset frame.
Slide the camera onto the extended mount rail. Plug the camera back in.

The eye camera arm extender works for all existing 120 and 200hz systems.

## Headset Adjustments

#### Slide Eye Camera
The eye camera arm slides in and out of the headset frame. You can slide the eye camera arm along the track.

#### Rotate World Camera
You can rotate the world camera up and down to align with your FOV.

#### Rotate Eye Camera
The eye camera arm is connected to the eye camera via the ball joint. You can rotate about its ball joint.

#### Ball Joint Set Screw
You can adjust the set screw to control the movement of the eye camera about the ball joint.
We recommend setting the set screw so that you can still move the eye camera by hand but not so loose that the eye camera moves when moving the head.
You can also tighten the set screw to fix the eye camera in place.

Before you calibrate, make sure to properly adjust the headset to get optimal eye detection and world camera FOV.

## Focus Camera

#### Focus World Camera

Set the focus for the distance at which you will be calibrating by rotating the camera lens.

#### No Focus 200Hz Eye Camera

200hz eye cameras do not need to be focused, and can not be focused. The lens of the 200hz eye camera is arrested using glue. Twisting the lens will risk breaking the mount.

#### Focus 120hz Eye Camera

If you have a 120hz eye camera, make sure the eye camera is in focus. Twist the lens focus ring of the eye camera with your fingers or lens adjuster tool to bring the eye camera into focus.
