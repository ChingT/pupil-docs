Welcome to Pupil Invisible developer docs!

## Recording Format

Similar to [Pupil Capture](/developer/core/recording-format/), the Pupil Invisible Companion
stores its data files in pairs: Each data file has a corresponding timestamp file. This
is required to correlate the different data source after-the-effect in Pupil Cloud or
Pupil Player.

You can find details to the specification of the Pupil Invisible Companion app recording
format in this [document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e1Xc1FoQiyf_ZHkSUnVdkVjdIanOdzP0dgJdJgt0QZg/edit?usp=sharing).
