# Analysis
There are different options available for analyzing recordings made with Pupil Invisible. You can use Pupil Cloud, our open-source analysis tool Pupil Player, or export recordings to other third party tools including your own custom software.

## Pupil Cloud
Pupil Cloud is a platform we have recently introduced. Currently it is a convenient solution for data collection and storage, but we will soon start adding analysis features as well. ==Is that ok to say like this?==

## Pupil Player
Pupil Player is our open-source analysis software originally created for ==Pupil Core==. It is compatible with Pupil Invisible recordings and offers a range of analysis options including AOI tracking and fixation detection. ==We have never tested fixation detection with PI. Is it ok to mention?== You can find information in the ==Pupil Player documentation==.

## Third Party Tools
You can also use Pupil Player to export Pupil Invisible recordings to a list of compatible third-party software, which includes iMotions and Blickshift. You can also export the raw data to CSV format and use it in your own custom software.
